# schizomida

These scripts are related to the collection and analysis of shape outline information for schizomids. They include reading in the shapes and information file as well as scripts for using existing packages for Fourier analysis, PCA, allometry, morphospace plotting, disparity-diversity correlation, and Gaussian mixture modelling. If you use these scripts for an academic work, please cite [TBA].


outline_analysis
This is the basic pipeline with data input, Fourier analysis, and disparity.

allometry_analysis
This script has the comparison of shape and centroids for the scaled dataset.

caribbean_only
This script is as outline_analysis but reduced for taxa from Caribbean islands.

cub_only
This script is as outline_analysis but reduced for Cuban taxa exclusively.

clustering
This script is for Gaussian clustering analysis.
